   abstract = {The idea that the success rate of a team increases when playing home is broadly accepted and documented for a wide variety of sports. Investigations on the so-called "home advantage phenomenon" date back to the 70's and ever since has attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies have been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate it with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is known about the effects of home advantage in the "microscopic" dynamics of the game (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this phenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the National Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more than sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that home advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the scoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams    playing home. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams, for instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased ≈0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing home, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate increases in only ≈0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these microscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when analyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams some regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average differences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to the time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time, suggesting a weakening of the phenomenon. This study thus adds evidence of the home advantage phenomenon and contributes to a deeper understanding of this effect over the course of games.},

   abstract = {To explore the dynamics involved in team coordination, we examine the impact of team familiarity and team leader experience on team coordination errors (TCEs). We argue that team familiarity has a U-shaped effect on TCEs. We study the moderating effects of team leader prior experience and team leader team-specific experience on the association between team familiarity and TCEs. We use panel data on teams from the National Basketball Association to test the hypotheses. Our findings support the U-shaped relationship between team familiarity and TCEs and the moderating effect of team leader team-specific experience on this relationship. The paper advances research on errors in organizations by analyzing the antecedents of TCEs, so far an underexplored empirical phenomenon. Moreover, it contributes to research on coordination in teams by empirically examining the interplay between formal and informal coordination mechanisms.},

abstract = {Teams experiencing highly competitive densities may be particularly exposed to performance breakdown and injury risk. The aim of this study was to analyse the association between fixture congestion cycles (playing back-to-back games, playing on one day's rest, playing on two day's rest, playing on three or more day's rest) and performance of NBA basketball teams. A total of 82 games from all teams participating in NBA 2016/2017 regular season were considered. Game-related statistics by fixture congestion cycles and game outcome were examined using the Pearson's Chi-Square test, Discriminant Analysis and Binary logistic regression. The results revealed that the likelihood of winning a game increased significantly from playing back-to-back games to having one day rest in between. Shooting efficacy-related statistics presented a considerable discriminatory power of the different fixture congestion cycles. In conclusion, fixture congestion cycles showed a significant impact on the game outcome and team performance. The findings may add value in the re-design of game schedules in the NBA as well as inform coaches to critically manage training load in order to enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury.},
